# Abstract
Forest fires pose significant threats to human life and natural resources, causing substantial economic losses. Computer vision technology, with its remarkable accuracy in minimizing these risks, has emerged as an indispensable tool for forest fire detection. This study provides a comprehensive review of advancements in computer vision techniques for forest fire detection over the past decade. We analyze the three core tasks of image classification, object detection, and image segmentation in detail. By examining the application of image processing and deep learning algorithms, we address the current challenges and explore potential future developments in this rapidly evolving field. Our review reveals that deep learning methods, despite their superior detection accuracy, face challenges such as data scarcity, class imbalance, and computational complexity. In contrast, image processing methods offer high computational efficiency but struggle with complex backgrounds. Here, we show that by combining the strengths of both approaches, researchers can develop more robust and efficient forest fire detection systems. This study provides valuable insights for developing advanced computer vision-based forest fire detection technologies.
